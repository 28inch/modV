#modV - dev branch
This is the ui-improvement branch of modV. It's the most up to date version of modV (even newer than the dev branch) therefore may not work as expected - you've been warned.

## Requirements
- [node](https://nodejs.org/download/) (v0.12.7)
- [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli)
- [Google Chrome desktop](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)

## Installation
* Download (clone or zip)
* Open a terminal, navigate to your downloaded folder (for example; ```cd ~/Downloads/modV-dev/```)
* Run ```npm install```, this will install modV's required packages
* Once the installation has finished, run ```grunt server```
* Open Chrome and go to ```http://localhost:3131```
