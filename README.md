# modV

modV is a modular audio visualisation environment written in JavaScript and runs in Google Chrome.

modV is not dead, check out the ui-improvements branch for the lastest activity!

Once the UI has been overhauled, I will merge onto the dev branch and then back to the master.

The plan is:
* get modV running as best as it can for a version 1 release
* create an Electron version
* then work on the remote control (if it is still applicable with the UI and complete format change)
