# modV dev branch
> JavaScript audio visualiser



## Requirements
- [node](https://nodejs.org/download/)
- [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli)


## Usage
Run:
```
npm install
```
in the modV directory to install the required packages.

Once all packages are installed run either:
```
grunt server
```
for normal usage 

or 
```
grunt no-manager
```
to run without the Media Manager.

modV will be available at 
```
http://localhost:3131
```

## Warning
This is the **dev** branch and has only been tested on Mac OS X.

I'm fairly certain the media manager won't work under Windows, but you're welcome to try and file a bug and or pull request if it doesn't work.
